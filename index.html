<h5>About Me</h5>
<p>
  I'm a software engineer at Microsoft interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
  Prior to working full-time, I studied at Princeton Unviersity, where I graduated in 2021 with a
  major in <a href="https://www.math.princeton.edu/undergraduate/majors/overview">mathematics</a> and
  certificates in <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/ugrad/overview">computer science</a> and 
  <a href="https://csml.princeton.edu/undergraduate/certificate-program">machine learning</a>. In
  my free time, I enjoy reading, weightlifting, and dabbling in foreign languages.
